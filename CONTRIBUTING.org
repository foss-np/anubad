#+STARTUP: overview

* Getting Started

** Prerequisite

   See README [[https://github.com/foss-np/anubad/tree/experimental#manual][#manual]]

** Coding Style

   - our coding style is loosly based on [[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/][PEP 8]]
   - *4* *spaces* for indentation is the [[https://github.com/Stitchpunk/atari-ai][must]]
   - try to fit each line with in *80* columns margin
   - if your indent more than 5 level, something not right

   We encourage move beyond the [[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/][PEP 8]] and code more pythonic and human
   readable form.

** Guidelines for new GNOME developers

   Beyond the prerequisite mentioned above, several tools available
   for assisting the development of *GNOME* application.

*** Recommended tools

    [[https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Devhelp][DevHelp]]: An API documentation browser for *GNOME*

    [[http://glade.gnome.org/][Glade]]: A GUI designer for *GTK+ Applications*

    A good *text-editor* or *IDE* (Integrated Development Environment)

* Inside Repository

  There are mainly 3 branches,

  | Branch       | Description                   |
  |--------------+-------------------------------|
  | master       | stable working version        |
  | dev          | version for power users       |
  | experimental | version for hackers/developer |


  Start with =dev= branch to begin development, =master= branch is
  usually *stable* branch for /common users/.

  If you want to be upto date with latest development use
  =experimental= which might be really :fire: *unstable* :fire:.
