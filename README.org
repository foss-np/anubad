   Earlier design was more focued on making the code run with various
   platforms, without installation.

   ./main.pyw
   #+end_src


** Gtk Version

   Anubad was re-written in /Gtk/, due font rendering issues, and poor
   system intergation in /tkinter/. Current development version is in
   /Gtk/.

   #+end_src
