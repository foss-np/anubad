  Two version are avaliable one with native python tkinter, and other
  in Gtk.

** Tkinter Version
   This was the earlier design with focus on making the code run with
   various platforms, its pretty robust and workable.

   - py2/3 compatible
   - Cross Platform (linux/mswin/) hopefully mac

   #+begin_src bash
   ./main.pyw
   #+end_src


** Gtk Version
   Due to the font rendering issues, and poor system intergation in
   linux tkinter, it was rewritten in Gtk with is still in development
   although both version will be supported for now.

   #+begin_src bash
   ./gtk3.py
   #+end_src
