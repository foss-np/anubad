** quick-demo

   Earlier design was more focued on making the code run with various
   platforms, which is written in python /tkinter/ which is no longer
   in development.

   - py2/3 compatible
   - Cross Platform (linux/mswin) hopefully mac

   #+begin_src bash
     cd src
     ./demo.pyw
   #+end_src


** Gtk Version

   Anubad was re-written in /Gtk/, due font rendering issues, and poor
   system intergation in /tkinter/. Current development version is in
   /Gtk/.

   #+begin_src bash
     cd src
     ./main.py
   #+end_src
