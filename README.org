** Symbolic Link

   Application can still be executable from anywhere if add symbolic
   link added *executable-path* i.e. paths defined under shell
   variable =$PATH=.

   This can be helpful while running *bleeding edge* directly from
   git repository or in development to avoid constant installation.

   #+begin_src bash
     $ cd anubad/src/
     $ sudo make link
   #+end_src

   to unlink use =sudo make unlink= in from same directory.

* Glossaries
