* Usage
** quick-demo

   Earlier design was more focused on making the code run with various
   platforms including python 2 and 3 compatibility, which is written
   in python /tkinter/ which is no longer in development.

   #+begin_src bash
     cd /path/to/anubad/src
     ./demo.pyw
   #+end_src


** Gtk version

   The *anubad* was re-written in /Gtk/, due font rendering issues,
   and poor system intergation in /tkinter/. Current development
   version is in /Gtk/.

   #+begin_src bash
     cd /path/to/anubad/src
     ./main.py
   #+end_src
