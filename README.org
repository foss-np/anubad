* Usage
** quick-demo

   Earlier design was more focused on making the code run with various
   platforms including python 2 and 3 compatibility, which is written
   in python /tkinter/ which is no longer in development due font
   rendering issues, and poor system intergation

   #+begin_src bash
     /path/to/anubad/demo.pyw
   #+end_src


** Gtk application

   #+begin_src bash
     cd /path/to/anubad/
     make
     # or direcly run
     /path/to/anubad/src/app.py
     # if problem occurs run
     /path/to/anubad/src/main.py
   #+end_src
