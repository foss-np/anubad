[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foss-np/anubad/dump/screenshots/00.png]]

The *anubad* is the /open sourced/ glossary browsing framework build
and designed not only for /translators/ and /localizers/ but also for
the common users.

Don't want to install? we have the [[https://github.com/foss-np/anubad-web][web-port]].

* Getting it
** Manual

   Make sure these requirements are fullfilled.

   | requirements          | linux          | ms-windows  |
   |-----------------------+----------------+-------------|
   | python                | python >= 3.00 | [[https://www.python.org/downloads/][python 3.xx]] |
   | gobject-introspection | python-gobject | pygi/base   |

   Latest version can be downloaded as [[https://github.com/foss-np/anubad/archive/master.zip][zip]]
   or [[https://github.com/foss-np/anubad/archive/master.tar.gz][tar]] or cloned.

   *TL;DR* requirements check the =./demo.pyw=, only requires
   _python_.


** Symbolic Link

   Application can still be executable from anywhere. Add symbolic
   link to *executable-path* i.e. paths defined under shell
   variable =$PATH=.

   This can be helpful while running *bleeding edge* version directly from
   git repository or in development to avoid frequent installation.

*** To link
   #+begin_src bash
     $ cd anubad/src/
     $ sudo make link
   #+end_src

*** To unlink
   #+begin_src bash
     $ sudo make unlink
   #+end_src

* Known Issues

  Sometime application tend to crash unexpectedly.

** Solution:
  Turn off the threading if it happens often (default: turned off).

  use =--nothread= argument to start `anubad` without threading

  Make changes in config file (=~/.config/anubad.ini=) to persist the
  change by adding =no-thread = True= in =[core]= section.

  #+begin_example
    [core]
    no-thread = True

  Default Application configuration is stored in =default.ini=. To add
  you own configuration edit =~/.config/anubad.ini=.
